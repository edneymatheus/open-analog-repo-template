# Magic RC (repo-local)
#
# This file is intentionally minimal. The goal is to keep the PDK mapping explicit.
#
# If you set PDK_ROOT and PDK in `env/env.sh`, you can load your PDK tech here.
#
# Examples (adjust to YOUR installation):
#   # Sky130:
#   # tech load ${PDK_ROOT}/${PDK}/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech
#
#   # IHP SG13G2:
#   # tech load ${PDK_ROOT}/${PDK}/libs.tech/magic/sg13g2.tech
#
# Tip: keep this file under version control so collaborators get the same setup.
