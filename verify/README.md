# Physical Verification (DRC / LVS / PEX)

This folder is reserved for physical verification workflows.
Intermediate logs should go to `verify/reports/` (ignored by git).

Typical flow:
- `verify/drc/` : DRC scripts and notes
- `verify/lvs/` : LVS scripts and notes
- `verify/pex/` : PEX/extraction scripts and notes
